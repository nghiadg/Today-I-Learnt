  <summary>Use AbortController to abort fetch or asynchronous tasks</summary>
  
  #### Create a controller:
  `const controller = new AbortController()`
  
  A controller have a single method `abort()` and a single property `signal` to set event listeners on it.
  
  When `abort()` is called
  
  1. `controller.signal` emits the `abort` event.
  2. `controller.signal.aborted` property becomes `true`
  
  To be able to cancel `fetch`, pass the `signal` property of an `AbortController` as a `fetch` option
  
  ```
const controller = new AbortController();
  fetch(url, {
    signal: controller.signal
  });
```
  
  The `fetch` knows how to work with `AbortController`. It will listen to abort events on signal. 
  And to abort `fetch`, call `controller.abort()`
  
  `fetch` get event from `signal` and abort the request.
  When `fetch` is aborted,  its promise rejects with an error `AbortError`, so we should handle it, e.g in `try catch`
